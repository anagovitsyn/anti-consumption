    <p><strong>Anti-consumption</strong> is a personal and cultural shift toward using fewer resources, buying less, and reducing dependence on material goods. It is not about sacrifice — it’s about sovereignty, sustainability, and intention.</p>

    <p>Closely related is <strong>anti-consumerism</strong>, a movement that questions the constant push to buy, upgrade, and accumulate. It asks deeper questions: *Do I really need this?* *Am I buying happiness — or distraction?*</p>

    <p>While anti-consumption focuses on <em>individual behavior</em>, anti-consumerism challenges the <em>systems and mindsets</em> that fuel overconsumption — marketing, social pressure, and economic incentives built on endless growth.</p>

    <p>If you're exploring ways to live with more clarity and less clutter, you're in the right place.</p>
